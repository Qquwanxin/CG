### hw2-Ray Tracing
- The entire program runs under Ubuntu. It has been tested in Ubuntu 18.10. 
- The file includes many header files and c++ files. The main.cc file is the main run file.
- Use the g++ instruction to compile it and then output to a ppm file via the >& instruction.
- This process can take a long time due to the large size of the data. Be patient or just change some parameters.
- Eventually you will get ppm files in the run directory.

Implement raytracing, phong shading and texture mapping etc. for cubes and spheres and the first two jobs for objects corresponding to the read off file. 
To view ppm files, if it is a Linux system, just Double click to open to view. Otherwise such as windows/mac, you need to download a ppm viewer.

There are some output of my results in the folder /images.
